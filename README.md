# Will You Be My Valentine? ðŸ’Œ

A charming, interactive webpage designed to ask someone to be your Valentine in a fun and playful way. This project features a runaway "No" button that playfully avoids being clicked, making "Yes" the inevitable, fun choice.

It's a single, self-contained HTML file with polished animations, background music, and an optional notification system to let you know when they've said yes!

## ðŸ”§ Customization

It's easy to make this page your own! Open the `index.html` file in any text editor to make these changes.

### Changing the Text

* **Main Question:** Find the `<h1>` tag inside the `<main>` section and change the text.
* **Success Message:** Find the `<h1>` tag inside the `<section id="success-container">` and change the text.
* **"No" Button Phrases:** In the `<script>` section at the bottom, find the `noButtonPhrases` array and edit the list of strings to your liking.

### Changing the Stickers (GIFs)

* **Main Sticker:** Find the `<img>` tag with the class `main-img` and replace the `src` link with a link to your chosen GIF.
* **Success Stickers:** Inside `<section id="success-container">`, there are two `<img>` tags (`intermediate-sticker` and `final-sticker`). Replace their `src` links with your chosen GIFs for the success animation.

### Changing the Music

1.  Get your desired audio file and rename it to **`song.mp3`**.
2.  Place it in the same folder as your `index.html` file, replacing the old one.
3.  *Alternatively*, if you have a direct URL to an `.mp3` file, you can find the `<audio>` tag and replace the `src="song.mp3"` with your URL.

### Setting up the Discord Webhook

1.  Create a webhook in your Discord server's settings (**Server Settings > Integrations > Webhooks**).
2.  Copy the Webhook URL.
3.  In the `<script>` section, find the line `const webhookURL = "YOUR_WEBHOOK_URL_HERE";` and paste your URL between the quotes.
